🌾 KisanSetu - Smart Agriculture Decision Support System
Problem Statement
Indian farmers face significant uncertainty due to fragmented agricultural data and climate volatility. Critical information regarding groundwater depletion, soil health, and market trends is often trapped in complex government reports or technical datasets (like 30-year groundwater PDFs). Without accessible insights, farmers rely on traditional guesswork, leading to the over-extraction of water in "dark zones," inappropriate crop selection for their specific soil/water profile, and eventual financial distress due to borewell failures and low crop yields.

Solution
KisanSetu is an integrated digital platform that bridges the gap between complex data and practical farming. By digitizing and analyzing decades of historical groundwater records (1994–2024), soil health parameters, and weather patterns, the system provides a simplified "single-window" dashboard. It features an intuitive, color-coded visual gauge for village-level water depth and a "Smart Crop Advisor" that cross-references environmental data to recommend sustainable, high-yield crops. This transforms raw data into a life-saving tool that helps farmers adopt climate-resilient practices, such as switching to millets or efficient irrigation, ensuring long-term agricultural sustainability and economic security.
